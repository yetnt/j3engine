# J3d Engine

This is a work-in-progress 3d Engine, which the final goal is to allow the creation of complex 3d objects and meshes all within Java and Swing.

This is a project for my 2026 Matric PAT for IT. I'll be documenting everything I learn and go through and dcoument everything extensively when a proper or stable version releases

## End Goal

A 3d Geometry Viewer and Editor with GUI and CAD-like command line input, object creation, edition, layers, etc.
